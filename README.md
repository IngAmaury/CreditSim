# CrediSim 🪙

This project is a simple credit simulator. It calculates a monthly amortization schedule (French system) and shows it in a table.
The backend also saves each simulation in a database, and it runs a mock “risk audit” asynchronously (it does not block the main response).

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (Vite).
- Backend: FastAPI(Python).
- Database: SQLite.
